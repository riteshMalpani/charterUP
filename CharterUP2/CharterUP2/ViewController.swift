//What I learned from this project.
//In this project, I no tonly gained new skills, but refined previous skills in app development. I have had expereince in the past with Swift and thus chose to make the app natively. The bigges obstacle in this project was time. This was a long weekend and in order to finish a fully functional and user inutitive app I had to gather my thoughts, make a few mock ups, and hit the computer coding quickly. In the past I made iOS apps using the storyboard which was a lot quicker, but gave less flexibility as to what I can do. Thus I recently started learning how to progrmatticaly code the whole application which takes a lot more time and is more advanced. Thus I really refined my skills and learned how to program out screens and make them all interact through the view controller. Specifically, I really enjoyed learning how to use the View Controller in a sophisticated way. For one, I set targets on buttons which call on a method once the button is clicked. This is essentially how i ran through the screens. Another cool method I learned to code was the hideKeyboardWhenTappedAround(). When a text field is clicked and the user begins typing, this method allows the user to exit out of the keyboard by tapping anywhere else on the screen. I also used learned to use text field delegates in this project to rescind the keyboard with teh return button. Another fascinating thing I learned was the textFieldDidBeginEditing() and textFieldDidEndEditing() at the bottom of the QuoteCalc file. These methods animated everything around once a text field begins or finished editing so that the user can see what they are typing as they keyboard is orignally blocking the text. All in all, I believe I took a lot away from coding a fairly sophisticated application in a very short amount of time. My biggest goal was to make an application that runs smoothly and also creates a user interface similar to the company website to make everything in the company unified. This is whyt I used pictures from the website, the company logo in several places, and the exact shade of blue that is the company color. Lastly, I have spent a good amount of time debugging the code so all edge cases should work perfectly and output the correct data. Daily rate was calculated by looking at the total hours of travel and dividing it by 24 to see the amount of days needed for travel. The hourly rate was calculated by taking the minutes and calculating them into hours and rounding up. For example, an 80 minute trip 2 ways would could as 4 hours, 2 hours each way as this is how hourly rates normally work. The mileage rate is fairly strightforward. Each of these calculations have coded edge cases and are multiplied by the amount of busses necessary to get an accurate figure times their respective multipliers.
